Ever thought it would be nice to be able to do TDD like the "gurus" - but unfortunately you weren´t able to pull it off? Ever skipped the refactoring step to continue with the next test case, because you wanted to get functionality faster out of the door? Come on, be honest.

If you´re dissatisfied with your current TDD practice, try the approach describe in this booklet. It adds two simple steps before the well known red+green+refactor. And it answers the question of whether to write white box tests or not.

What you´ll learn is a straightforward and systematic approach to coding over the safety net of tests. It builds on TDD as traditionally taught, but makes explicit what so far has been hidden or even neglected in demonstrations: the thinking behind the solutions. And by making thinking an "official part" of TDD it leads to code with less need for refactoring.

Informed TDD is TDD on the next level. By letting yourself not be surprised by a solution your red+green flow will be less accidental and more top-down. Also your code will be easier to understand, because it will contain abstractions devised during an explicit solution finding step.
